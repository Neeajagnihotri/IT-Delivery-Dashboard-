# IT Delivery Dashboard - Unified Entity Relationship Diagram

## Database Overview
The IT Delivery Dashboard uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL database designed to handle enterprise-level resource allocation, project management, and analytics as a single unified system. The database follows normalization principles and includes audit trails, performance tracking, and real-time analytics capabilities for complete IT delivery management.

## Unified System Architecture

This is a **single integrated system** that supports:
- **Resource Management**: Complete employee lifecycle management
- **Project Management**: End-to-end project delivery tracking  
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Real-time dashboards and KPI monitoring
- **Financial Tracking**: Budget management and cost analysis
- **Quality Assurance**: QA metrics and testing oversight
- **Engineering Metrics**: Development productivity tracking
- **Escalation Management**: Issue tracking and resolution

## Core Entity Groups

### 1. **System & Authentication**
- **users**: System authentication and role-based access
- **departments**: Organizational structure with budget tracking
- **audit_logs**: Complete change history and compliance

### 2. **Resource Management**
- **resources**: Complete employee/contractor profiles with shadow tracking
- **skills**: Technology and competency catalog
- **resource_skills**: Skills mapping with proficiency levels
- **salary_details**: Compensation information (HR-only access)
- **resource_availability**: Leave and availability tracking
- **performance_reviews**: Performance evaluation system

### 3. **Project Delivery**
- **clients**: Customer relationship management
- **projects**: Project lifecycle with health tracking
- **project_allocations**: Resource assignment and utilization
- **deliverables**: Milestone and deliverable tracking
- **time_entries**: Detailed time tracking and billing

### 4. **Quality & Engineering**
- **engineering_metrics**: Development productivity and quality
- **qa_metrics**: Testing coverage and quality assurance
- **escalations**: Issue tracking and resolution management

### 5. **Financial & Analytics**
- **financial_tracking**: Budget vs actual cost analysis
- **company_kpis**: Organization-wide performance indicators

## Key Relationships and Business Logic

### Resource Management Flow
```
users -> resources -> departments
resources -> resource_skills -> skills  
resources -> project_allocations -> projects
resources -> performance_reviews (reviewer/reviewee)
resources -> salary_details (HR access)
```

### Project Delivery Flow
```
clients -> projects -> deliverables
projects -> project_allocations -> resources
project_allocations -> time_entries
projects -> engineering_metrics
projects -> qa_metrics  
projects -> escalations
projects -> financial_tracking
```

### Analytics and Reporting Flow
```
All entities -> audit_logs (change tracking)
Multiple sources -> company_kpis (aggregated metrics)
departments -> financial_tracking (budget analysis)
```

## Enhanced Features for IT Delivery

### Shadow Resource Tracking
- **shadow_progress**: 0-100% completion tracking
- **shadow_status**: 'Observation' → 'Learning' → 'Transition' → 'Completed'
- Automatic status updates based on progress thresholds

### Project Health Monitoring
- **health_score**: 0-100 project health indicator
- **health_status**: 'Green', 'Yellow', 'Red' visual indicators
- **delivery_risk**: Risk assessment levels
- **escalation_count**: Automatic escalation tracking

### Advanced Analytics Views
- **v_resource_allocation**: Real-time resource utilization
- **v_project_health**: Project dashboard overview
- **v_department_performance**: Department-wise analytics
- **v_resource_performance_hr**: HR performance insights
- **v_financial_summary**: Financial health tracking

## Data Security and Access Control

### Role-Based Permissions
- **hr**: Full access to salary and personal information
- **resource_manager**: Resource allocation and performance data
- **leadership**: Financial and strategic analytics
- **delivery_owner**: Project and delivery metrics
- **admin**: Full system access

### Audit and Compliance
- Complete change tracking with user attribution
- Timestamp automation for all updates
- IP address and user agent logging
- Sensitive data protection with row-level security

## Performance Optimizations

### Strategic Indexing
- Multi-column indexes for common query patterns
- Partial indexes on active records only
- Date range indexes for time-based queries
- Foreign key relationship optimization

### Query Optimization
- Materialized views for complex analytics
- Efficient JOIN strategies in database views  
- Query plan optimization for dashboard real-time updates

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- RESTful API endpoints for all entities
- Real-time dashboard data feeds
- Export capabilities for reporting
- Mobile-responsive data access

### Backend Services
- Flask API with full CRUD operations
- Authentication and authorization middleware
- Data validation and business rule enforcement
- Automated notification systems

### External Integrations
- Export to Excel/PDF for reporting
- Third-party tool integrations via REST APIs
- Webhook support for external notifications
- Data import/export utilities

## Sample Data Structure

The database includes comprehensive sample data for:
- **10 sample employees** across 6 departments
- **5 active projects** with realistic timelines
- **15+ skills** across technology categories
- **Complete financial tracking** with budgets and actuals
- **Performance metrics** with realistic KPI values
- **Time entries and availability** for testing workflows

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Table partitioning strategies for large datasets
- Archive tables for historical data retention
- Read replica support for analytics workloads
- Connection pooling for high concurrency

### Data Archival
- Automated archival of old time entries
- Compressed storage for historical metrics
- Retention policies for audit logs
- Performance optimization for active data

This unified schema eliminates redundancy while providing comprehensive functionality for the complete IT Delivery Dashboard ecosystem.
